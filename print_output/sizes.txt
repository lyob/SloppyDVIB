MLP is of the form 784 - 1024 - 1024 - 256

encoder/fully_connected/biases:		1024
encoder/fully_connected/weights:	1024 * 784 = 802816

encoder/fully_connected_1/biases:	1024
encoder/fully_connected_1/weights:	1024 * 1024 = 1048576

encoder/fully_connected_2/biases:	512
encoder/fully_connected_2/weights:	512 * 1024 = 524288

decoder/fully_connected/biases: 	10
decoder/fully_connected/weights: 	10 * 256 = 2560
