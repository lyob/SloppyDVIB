# Sloppy models and Deep Variational Information Bottleneck exploration

Using Python version 3 and Tensorflow version 1.13

Based on the DVIB [paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg) and [code](https://github.com/alexalemi/vib_demo) by Alemi, Murphy et al. 

I recommend running the Python file on Visual Studio Code; this will allow each "cell" of code (demarcated by #%%) to be run individually, much like in a Jupyter notebook.

Code for data viewing/extraction and comment lines beginning with double hashtags (##) are by Ben Lyo.
