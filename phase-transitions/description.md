Folders:

- **beta-exploration**: testing the effects of beta parameter on model accuracy and Mutual info

- **hd-beta-expl**: testing the effects of the bottleneck size on accuracy and mutual info 

- **small-network**: testing the effects of smaller network sizes (100-100-2K) to (50-50-2K) or smaller. Jumping point for future FIM calculations during training.
